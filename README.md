## Analysis of all earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 or larger over the past 30 days

There are three main files wihtin this repository.  A CSS and JS located within the static folder and also the index.html.

All codes were based on exercises done in the bootcamp except for the legend.  Extensive "googling" and youtube videos eventually resulted in that code.

The earthquake markers are now an overlay layer marked as "Earthquakes" in order for better viewing



Below is a snapshot of an expected output of the map.  

The legend shown represents depth of the earthquake.  Sizes of the circles are indicative of the magnitude.
